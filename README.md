proxy_backlog
=============

Irssi script for fetching backlog when connecting to Irssi proxy.

This is a fork of http://wouter.coekaerts.be/irssi/proxy_backlog

Added features:
---------------
  * Backlog is fetched automatically when client connects to the proxy
  * Lines with `----` are not forwarded to deal better with [trackbar](https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org/blob/gh-pages/scripts/trackbar.pl)
